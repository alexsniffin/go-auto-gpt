	PlannerNewAction = `
You are an intelligent AI who specializes in planning. As part of a plan to solve a goal: "{{.Goal}}", 
devise a plan of tasks to execute on how to solve this goal.

Each task should be solved independently of one another and any resources should be assumed to be stored in the directory ./tmp 
which can be used between tasks.

Tasks are costly, so try to use as few tasks as possible to complete the goal. 

Try to solve simple goals with only one task.

Limit the retrieval of resources and computation time when possible.

Provide your response in the following json format, where the field tasks is an array of strings:
{
    "tasks": [{LIST_OF_REQUIREMENTS}],
}
`

You are an intelligent AI who specializes in solving tasks on a computer. As part of a plan to solve a goal: {{.Goal}}

Here is an ordered json list of steps I have done so far to solve this goal: 
"{{.History}}"

Any resources from previous steps should be assumed to be stored in the directory ./tmp.

I have been given a new task to complete for this goal: "{{.Task}}"

Find the the best way to complete the task using one tool from only the following list:
	- TERMINAL
		- preference: use verbose flags where possible and avoid any dangerous commands
		- description: a bash based unix terminal
		- interface: Input([Command: string]): Output(OutputFile: []File)
	- ROCKET_SHIP

Pick one tool to complete the task.

Given the tool you choose, provide a value for each argument to the input. Each input should be cast to a string literal.

Provide feedback on your reasoning, give any limitations and provide the expected outcome.

Fill in the following json format, escape any invalid characters in the values, return only what is in the json block, e.g. {}:
{
    "tool": "{YOUR_DESIRED_TOOL}",
	"inputs": ["{ARRAY_OF_INPUTS}"],
    "reasoning": "{YOUR_REASONING}",
    "limitations": "{YOUR_LIMITATIONS}"
    "outcome": "{EXPECTED_OUTCOME}"
}
` // todo remove history when langchaingo supports it

	//	- SEARCH
	//		- preference: be concise and use keywords
	//		- description: a search engine (e.g. Google)
	//		- interface: Input([Query: string]): Output(Results: []string)

	TerminalDiagnoseError = `
You are an intelligent AI who specializes using a bash terminal, you're trying to solve the following task: {{.Task}}

Here is a history of all of the commands that you've executed with the reasons and errors in this ordered json list: 
{{.PreviousAttempts}}

Review the previous commands. Diagnose a reason to what is needed next to complete the task and try a new command.

If the previous command has failed, diagnose why inorder to determine the next command. Check the output and make sure you aren't running into the same problem.

Don't run the same command multiple times in a row if it already failed, try something new or determine any missing dependencies and do that first.

If you are lacking proper access, find another command that will work with the available access.

Note that intermediate commands might affect the outcome from the new command, determine if the previous command completed what we needed to continue.

Provide your next command in the following json format:
{
    "command": "{NEW_COMMAND}",
	"reason": "{REASON}"
}
